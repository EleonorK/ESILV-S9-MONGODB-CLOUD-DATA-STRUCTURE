# MyAnimeList Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the MyAnimeList dataset, aiming to uncover trends and insights within the anime community through detailed analysis and visualization. Our study focuses on various aspects such as popularity, ratings, genres, and viewer preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patmendoza/myanimelist-api?resource=download), providing a comprehensive collection of anime series information.

## Report and Analysis
A thorough report documents our findings, analyzing the data to extract meaningful patterns and understand the dynamics of anime series' success and audience preferences.

## Streamlit Application
To complement our analysis, a Streamlit application was developed, offering an interactive platform for users to query and visualize the anime data dynamically. This application allows for an engaging exploration of the dataset, enhancing the accessibility of our findings.

## Team Collaboration
This project was realized in collaboration by a group of four members, demonstrating the collaborative effort in tackling complex data analysis challenges.

## Requirements
Two separate `requirements.txt` files are provided for different components of the project:
- For the Streamlit application.
- For the query processing functionality.

Please refer to the respective `requirements.txt` for installation instructions to ensure the proper environment setup for each component.

## Usage
To use the Streamlit application or run the query processing scripts, follow the installation steps detailed in the respective `requirements.txt` files and execute the Python scripts or launch the Streamlit app as instructed within the project documentation.
